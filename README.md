### Tableau Citibikes Analysis

####
Since 2013, the Citi Bike Program has implemented a robust infrastructure for collecting data on the program's utilization. Through the team's efforts, each month bike data is collected, organized, and made public on the Citi Bike Data webpage.

Using the aggregate the data found in the Citi Bike Trip History Logs, I built a set of data reports using Tableau and provided a story on the state of the Citi Bikes program.
